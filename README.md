# Iris Species Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project demonstrates how to implement a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier using the **Iris dataset**, and provides an interactive **Gradio UI** to:
- Upload a CSV dataset and train the model with user-defined `k`
- Input flower measurements and predict the species
- View model accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

---

## Features

-  Upload your own `iris.csv` file
-  Choose the value of `k` (number of neighbors)
-  Train and evaluate a KNN model
-  Predict flower species by entering sepal and petal dimensions
-  Simple and intuitive Gradio web interface

---

## Model and Evaluation

- Algorithm: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Metrics: 
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

##  Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn gradio
```
## Run the App
```bash
python app.py
```
This will launch a browser window with two tabs:

Train Model: Upload CSV and enter value of k

Predict: Enter flower measurements to get predictions

## Project Structure
```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py               # Main Gradio script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ iris.csv             # Dataset (can upload your own)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Optional dependency list
